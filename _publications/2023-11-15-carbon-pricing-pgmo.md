excerpt: 'In this work, we adapt an optimal pricing framework [1] to the case of carbon pricing by including a climate model. We consider a set of countries N willing to maximize their own utility function modeled by \\[\forall n \in N, u_n(e_n,P)= b_n(en)−P e_n\\] with en the CO2 emission level of country \\(n\\), \\(P\\) the price of carbon and \\(b_n\\) is the benefit function of country \\(n\\). These benefit functions are assumed to be sigmoidal and represent the evolution of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country depending on its CO2 emissions...'
